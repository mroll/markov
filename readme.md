# markov

This script computes text using a markov chain process. Given text files
as command line arguments, it builds a hash table with info about what
words follow what sequences of words and how often. The script has
functions that give you back sentences and paragraphs of markov
generated text.

My sample text files are from Project Gutenberg and textfiles.com.
